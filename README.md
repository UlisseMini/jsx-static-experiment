An experiment with purely static site generation using jsx and react. (no hydration at all).
I was going to use this for my website, but reinventing the wheel was not worth it ):
So I'll just be using nextjs, even though its suboptimal (`__NEXT_DATA__` hydrating static pages, ugh) I think I can survive my guilt.
